# Composite
A combo Top down shooter / Auto-Battler primarily inspired by Despot's Game

Complex/Compound/Composite

Take on the role of Complex, an ex-Amalgam Compound as they lead an army of Prims against their once bretheren of the Amalgamation of Verts.  Defeat enemies to take their Prims, whether to lead them or use them is up to you.    Essentially this is an attempt to merge together the Auto-Battler and Top down shooter genres that I have been interested in recently. Intent is to add another dimension to both, choosing whether to further upgrade yourself or improve the strength of your allies.
